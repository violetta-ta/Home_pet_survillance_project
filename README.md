# Home_pet_survillance_project
This is a project for a pet survillance using Raspberry PI and a set of sensors.
The motivation for the project was to get the understanding of what the hamster doing over the day and night in his cage, and what his living conditions are (how contaminated is the cage, if he has enough water and things to do).
